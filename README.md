### Hi there! 👋

Hi, I'm Azura, a recent fresh graduate in compsci!

👩🏽‍💻 I like developing and building things. I'm particulary most interested in mobile (iOS) and game development. Aside from tech, I'm also highly interested int the world of UX.

🤓 My current goal is to explore everything the tech world has to offer that catches my interest.
