### Hi fellas! ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm a final year computer science student exploring my interests in app development!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my thesis! I am making a VR based game for colour blind test. I will make the code public as soon as I'm finished, so, please look forward to it :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many many things~~ I'm interested in various fields of programming from web, mobile, and game development to machine learning and data science. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I can contribute on that leaves an impact for other people. Particularly interested in empowering more women in tech! \\^0^/
